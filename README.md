# hello-world
First repository


Hey guys!
  I may be new to coding, but the moment I said "Hello World" in python I was hooked. For the first time in my life I felt as if I was actually learning useful tools and skills. From then on, everyday has been devoted to learning different languages and frameworks in hopes of one day soon becoming a developer.
